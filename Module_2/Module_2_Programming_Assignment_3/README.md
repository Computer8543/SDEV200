## Purpose of the program
The purpose of the program is to create a method called bin2Dec that converts a binary string into a decimal number. This method will throw a custom exception called BinaryFormatException if the string isn't actually a binary string. The bin2Dec method will be used in a test program called App.java that will prompt the user to enter in a binary string, then display the equivalent decimal number to the user.
